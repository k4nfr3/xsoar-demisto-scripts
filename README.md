# xsoar-demisto-scripts

Working for a little time as a DEVOps on Palo Alto Networks XSOAR (aka Demisto), here are a few scripts that I had to create which helped my with some tasks.

## get_roles.yml
A little python script to get the role of a user. I've used this when creating conditional tasks checking if the agent was a Level 1 or Level 2 support.


## ReopenIncidents.yml
A little script which uses the rest API of Demisto to reopen a case as there is no built in command by default for this.

## FindingKeywordinList.yml
A little python script to lookup in a list (given as argument) some keyword.
